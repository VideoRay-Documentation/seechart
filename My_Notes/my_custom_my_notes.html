<div style="font-family:arial;font-size:.8em">
<p>This is a sample <b>My_Note</b>.  You can include formatting, working links to other web pages, such as <a href="http://www.videoray.com" target="_blank">www.videoray.com</a>, or images like the tip icon below.<p>

<p><img src="images/icon_tip.gif"> Even if you don't know HTML, you can still create My_Notes using plain text.  Simply add <i>&LT;pre&GT;</i> at the beginning of your text file and <i>&LT;/pre&GT;</i> at the end.  This is not strictly required, but preserves the layout.</p>

<pre style="font-size:1.2em">
This section is written as plain text.  It does not contain HTML,
but still maintains its layout, including    spaces    and line breaks.
</pre>

<p style="font-size:.8em">This My_Note file can be found at: C:\Users\VideoRay\Documents\VideoRay\My_Notes\my_custom_my_notes.html</p>
